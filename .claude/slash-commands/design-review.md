OBJECTIVE:
Review the complete diff above for the Angular Single-SPA application. This contains all recent code changes.

1. First, ensure the application is running (check ports 3000, 4200, 4202)
2. If not running, start it with: cd /home/knimi/angular-single-spa && npm run start:all
3. Review the code changes focusing on:
   - UI/UX consistency between Angular and React MFEs
   - Adherence to the design system in CLAUDE.md
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
   - Responsive design implementation
   - Performance implications
   - Single-SPA integration correctness

4. Test the changes by:
   - Opening http://localhost:3000 in a browser
   - Navigating between Angular and React modules
   - Testing responsive breakpoints
   - Checking browser console for errors

5. Generate a comprehensive design review report following this structure:
